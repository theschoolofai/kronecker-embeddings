"""
Spelling-robustness probe (paper Section 6.11).

For each (clean, typo) prompt pair, compute four metrics on each arm
(BPE-trained model vs Kronecker-trained model):

  1. KL(clean || typo) over the full vocab distribution
  2. cosine(final_hidden_clean, final_hidden_typo)
  3. log P(clean_top1 | clean) - log P(clean_top1 | typo)        — log-prob drop
  4. binary: top1(clean) == top1(typo)                            — stability

110 (clean, typo) pairs across 11 categories (geography, math, time, colors,
idioms, body, animals, counting, syntax, misc, people). The typo is always
a 1-2 character change in one content word.

Usage::

    python probes/robustness_probe.py \\
        --bpe-checkpoint /path/to/bpe_model.pt \\
        --kron-checkpoint /path/to/kron_model.pt \\
        --output probes/data/robustness_results.json

Checkpoint requirement
----------------------
This probe requires two trained checkpoints — one with a stock nn.Embedding
("BPE") and one with KroneckerEmbedding ("Kron"). The paper's 124M-param
checkpoints are not in this repo (they were lost). To reproduce: train
two matched 124M nanoGPT models — one stock, one Kronecker — for the same
number of steps on the same data. Then pass their paths via the CLI args.

The 110-prompt set below is the same one used in the paper.
